##Save A Stray
####a mobile (react-native) app for iOS and Android!  

(Updated Sept 2018 to use new yelp-fusion API)

This is the iOS repo.  Ignore the Android folder in this repo, lots of reworking was done to optimize for Android like navigation and different list components.  I put it in another repo.

"Hey I see your secret keys in your git history!" No you don't, I've updated them.
